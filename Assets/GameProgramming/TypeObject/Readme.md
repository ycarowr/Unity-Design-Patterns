# Type Object

## Definition

"Define a type object class and a typed object class. Each type object instance represents a different logical type. Each typed object stores a reference to the type object that describes its type."

Basically replace overriden methods by an object that wraps the behavior/data. And use it for all instances that share it. It is another way to move away from inheritance.

## When use it

1. You donâ€™t know what types you will need up front
2. You want to be able to modify or add new types without having to recompile or change code.

### Notes
- You move the Type from Code to Data. The flexibility is good, but you lose some things by hoisting your types into data.
- We need to make sure the Types are loaded in memory because they are now objects, and not part of the language done in compilation time.
- It is much more complex to add new behaviors to specific Types because we don't have code (this point not valid for Scriptable Objects).
