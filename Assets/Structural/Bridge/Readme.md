# Bridge

## Definitions

"Let you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other."

When to use: 
1. Decouple an abstraction from the implementation therefore both can vary independently.
2. Share same implementation for multiple objects
3. Hide details from clients
4. Brings more flexibility, Cartesian Product see: [Christopher Okhravi](https://youtu.be/F1YQ7YRjttI?list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc)

Notes: 
1. Similar to adapter: Adapter makes things work after they're designed; Bridge makes them work before they are.
2. All examples are quite different but have the same idea in common: To split Abstraction and Implementation
